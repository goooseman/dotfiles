## Magic Enter

**Maintainer:** [@dufferzafar](https://github.com/dufferzafar)

Makes your enter key magical, by binding commonly used commands to it.

You can set the commands to be run in your .zshrc, before the line containing plugins!

```bash
MAGIC_ENTER_GIT_COMMAND='git status -u .'
MAGIC_ENTER_OTHER_COMMAND='ls -lh .'

plugins=(magic-enter)
```
