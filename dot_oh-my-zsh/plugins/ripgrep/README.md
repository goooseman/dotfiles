# ripgrep

This plugin adds completion for the text search tool [`ripgrep`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep), also known as `rg`.

To use it, add `ripgrep` to the plugins array in your zshrc file:

```zsh
plugins=(... ripgrep)
```

Completion is taken from the ripgrep release [`0.10.0`](https://github.com/BurntSushi/ripgrep/releases/tag/0.10.0).
